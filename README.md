# Swift on Sockets - SoS

## What is SoS?
A best-of-breed "Swifty" networking socket layer. Built from the ground up with Swift 3 to be cross-platform and IPv4/IPV6 capable.

## Why do I need SoS?
Ease of use for developers. SoS provides a "Swifty 3" API for socket management and IP address handeling.

## Is SoS scalable?
Implementing a high-scale, non-blocking socket layer to build robust, high-scale cloud services was the goal. Ultimately, SoS is a thin layer over native OS sockets.
