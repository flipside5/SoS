# Swift on Sockets - SoS

## What is SoS?
A best-of-breed "Swifty" networking socket layer. Built from the ground up with Swift to be cross-platform and IPv4/IPv6 capable. Compiles using Swift 3.1, 3.2 and Swift 4.0. How cool is that?!

## Why do I need SoS?
Ease of use for developers while proving a flexible and powerful API. SoS provides a "Swifty" API for socket management and IP address handeling.

## Is SoS scalable?
The primary goal is to provide an foundational framework to implement highly-scale, robust cloud services. It works.
