# Swift on Sockets - SoS

## What is SoS?
A best-of-breed "Swifty" networking socket layer. Built from the ground up with Swift 3 to be cross-platform and IPv4/IPv6 capable.

## Why do I need SoS?
Ease of use for developers. SoS provides a "Swifty 3" API for socket management and IP address handeling.

## Is SoS scalable?
The primary goal is to provide an foundational framework to implement high-scale, non-blocking, robust cloud services. It works.
